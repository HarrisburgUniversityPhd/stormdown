# Conclusion

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.
[@von_goethe_wilhelm_1829]

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph.
Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
